# [Russia's Cyber Attack](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-hack-russia-cyberattack-60-minutes-2021-02-14/)

Cyber attacks are extremely relevant and is a rising issue that I believe will become very threatening in the future if nothing is done. This article talks about major companies such as Microsoft being hacked into by Russian hackers and stealing valuable information. Even more alarming, these hackers spent 9 months filtering through classified data being held in the U.S. departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce. It blows my mind that our own government could allow these types of malicious hacks on themselves. I do not feel safe knowing that our government cannot protect itself against these attacks. I also found it intriguing that it too them a whole 9 months to figure it out. I wonder how they found out and their reaction to finding out. Overall I thought it was a very well written article and did not require much knowledge of computer science to read and understand.

I find it ever more obvious that in the age of technology we're in now, the scope of a crime one is able to commit has drastically increased, much like when talking about how productivity of a development team is inversely proportional to its size due to the lack of physical labor required, the same applies to the cybercrimes where you simply need 1 piece of code, and it can easily propagate through out a nation

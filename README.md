# [Russia's Cyber Attack](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-hack-russia-cyberattack-60-minutes-2021-02-14/)

Cyber attacks are extremely relevant and is a rising issue that I believe will become very threatening in the future if nothing is done. This article talks about major companies such as Microsoft being hacked into by Russian hackers and stealing valuable information. Even more alarming, these hackers spent 9 months filtering through classified data being held in the U.S. departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce. It blows my mind that our own government could allow these types of malicious hacks on themselves. I do not feel safe knowing that our government cannot protect itself against these attacks. I also found it intriguing that it too them a whole 9 months to figure it out. I wonder how they found out and their reaction to finding out. Overall I thought it was a very well written article and did not require much knowledge of computer science to read and understand.
